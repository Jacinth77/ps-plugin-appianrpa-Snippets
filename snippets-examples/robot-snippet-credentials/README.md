## Robot Snippet Credentials


The Credentials Snippet Example provides a complete usage example from all the
[CredentialsUtils](https://github.com/appianps/ps-plugin-appianrpa-Snippets/tree/master/snippets-libraries/snippet-credentials) snippet methods. The robot will retrieve three existent
credentials (Username + Password) associated to the application "TEST_ROBOT".
In case that these three credentials were not previously created in the
console side, the application will throw an exception.
